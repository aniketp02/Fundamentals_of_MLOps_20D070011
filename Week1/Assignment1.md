## AIOps

AIOps is the application of artificial intelligence to IT operations. It has become essential for monitoring and managing modern IT environments that are hybrid, dynamic, distributed and componentized.

Through algorithmic analysis of IT data, AIOps helps IT Ops and DevOps teams work smarter and faster, so they can detect digital-service issues earlier and resolve them quickly, before business operations and customers are impacted.

Specifically, AIOps uses big data, analytics, and machine learning capabilities to do the following:

- Collect and aggregate the huge and ever-increasing volumes of operations data generated by multiple IT infrastructure components, applications, and performance-monitoring tools
- Intelligently sift ‘signals’ out of the ‘noise’ to identify significant events and patterns related to system performance and availability issues.
- Diagnose root causes and report them to IT for rapid response and remediation or, in some cases, automatically resolve these issues without human intervention.

It bridges the gap between an increasingly diverse, dynamic, and difficult-to-monitor IT landscape, on the one hand, and user expectations for little or no interruption in application performance and availability, on the other. Most experts consider AIOps to be the future of IT operations management.


## MLOps v/s AIOps

MLOps and AIOPs both share the willingness to make our systems better and more efficient, the two fields overlap but do not meet under the same umbrella, neither in terms of the approach nor in terms of the raison d'être.

While AIOps helps teams automate their tech lifecycles, MLOps helps teams choose which tools, techniques, and documentation will help their models reach production.

When applied to the right problems, AIOps and MLOps can both help teams hit their production goals.



## Interpretable Machine Learning for Linear Regression


### Interpretable Machine Learning

The sort of decisions and predictions being made by these machine learning-enabled systems are becoming much more profound, and in many cases, critical to life, death, and personal wellness. The need to trust these AI-based systems is paramount.

Interpretation of a machine learning model is the process wherein we try to understand the predictions of a machine learning model.


### Linear Regression

Linear models can be used to model the dependence of a regression target y on some features x. The learned relationships are linear and can be written for a single instance i as follows:

<p> y = &beta;<sub>0</sub> + &beta;<sub>1</sub>x<sub>1</sub> + ... + &epsilon; </p>

The predicted outcome of an instance is a weighted sum of its features. The betas ( &beta;<sub>j</sub> ) represent the learned feature weights or coefficients.


### Interpretation

In linear regression we can use the weights (or coefficients) to find out which features are the most important, these are the features with the highest weight. If, for one record, we add one to a feature value while keeping the others the same the prediction will increase by the weight of that feature.
